# To-do-List
A Basic To-do list where you can check off complete tasks and delete tasks that are not needed
There are two columns in the list.
A Incompleted tasks column and a completed tasks column.
When an incomplete task is completed you can check it off, it will then be moved across to the completed tasks section (column).
This is so that you can see all the tasks that you have completed.
You can then delete the tasks that are completed from the completed tasks section at the end of the day.
