# TODO Task List (Advanced Version, focussing on persistent data)

As mentioned before, the main purpose of the exercise is using what we learned today to allow for persistent data across browser sessions. Don't focus too much on the visuals unless you have things such as local storage down 

Requirements for the ToDo application:
1.)  User should be able to add tasks to a list

2.) User should be able to cross off tasks from the list to mark them as done (Completed Tasks should be readable, don't just make them disappear)

3.)  User should be able to delete tasks (maybe they made a typo or no longer need to do that task today) AND add tasks to the list of tasks

4.) User should be able to complete a task close application, and return and **see that their task list persists** (including "completed" tasks remaining "completed" and "incomplete" remaining "incomplete"


Stretch Goals:
Allow users to give each task a "priority level". For example on a scale of 1-5, a task having a priority of 1 means "this task must be done before all others" and a priority of 5 may mean "this task is optional if all others are completed). Visually represent this along to the user in an easy to understand way

Categorize tasks and allow the users to filter/search by category (Work tasks, Daily Chores, Study topics etc etc)

Allow users to see "stats" for their tasks that you believe would assist them. For example, allow the user to "start" a task and then track how long it takes to finish it. Track how many incomplete tasks there are every day, etc etc

Incorporate Dates on tasks to allow for planning tasks and days in the future. Ideally users will have a calendar visual to be able to select dates and assign tasks to those dates. 

Stretch Stretch Goal:
Alone with adding a property to tasks to allow for date tracking, attempt to incorporate the Google Calendar API (either at a basic level, reading your own calendar and creating "events" from it, or fully by allowing your tasks to be posted your own Google Calendar)
